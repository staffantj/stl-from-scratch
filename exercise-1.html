<h2>Exercise 1. Hello world!</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the course!

<p>
We'll be using Wandbox to deliver the code for these exercises.
Wandbox is an online C++ compiler; that is, it's a Web interface to a plain old C++ compiler
running somewhere on the back-end. Wandbox supports both GCC and Clang.

<p>
Wandbox lets you type in some C++ code and hit "Run" to compile and run it. After you've hit
"Run", Wandbox also gives you the option to "Share" a permalink to your code. The shareable
permalink is a <i>snapshot</i> of your code as it appeared when you hit "Share". It is not a
shared-editing <i>session</i> like a Google Doc. When you or someone else visits the permalink,
they'll get a copy of the code; modifying the copy won't affect the original. So this makes
it a great way to distribute the code for these exercises!

<p>
(In case Wandbox goes down during the class, I've got backup copies of all the code on this
website. The raw .cc files are linked right next to the links to Wandbox. If GitHub goes
down during the class, we'll have trouble.)

<p>
The upside is that you can edit the code at these permalinks any way you want; your solutions
will be visible only to you, not to everyone. The downside is that I won't be able to see
your solutions either, unless I come look over your shoulder. So I have no very good way of
finding out when everyone's done with the exercise, nor if anyone's stumped.

<p>
Before each exercise set, I'll set my phone's timer for 10 minutes. If it looks like I'm
forgetting to do this, please remind me!

<p>
If you're completely stumped after a few minutes, feel free to raise your hand and I'll
come over to you. (Or one of your fellow classmates might see your hand first and be able
to help!)

<p>
If you're done before the timer is up, feel free to play around in Wandbox, or do your own
stuff. Each page of exercises ends with some random links to blog posts that I think are
worth passing along to you.


<h3>Exercise 1a. Hello wandbox</h3>

<p>
Open <a href="https://wandbox.org/permlink/S9IkjTPPIJBioZhU">this link</a>
(<a href="1a.cc">backup</a>).
You should see a "hello world" program.

<p>
1. Find the "Run" button and click it to run the code.

<p>
2. Edit the code so that it prints "Hello wandbox" instead of "Hello world". Run it again,
using the compiler of your choice.

<p>
3. Find the "Share" button and click it to get a permalink to your "Hello wandbox" code.

<p>
4. (Optional) Email your permalink to <code>Arthur O'Dwyer &lt;arthur.j.odwyer@gmail.com&gt;</code>.
I won't be checking my email as part of the class, but now we'll have each other's email
addresses if you want to ask any followup questions during or after this week's conference.


<h3>Exercise 1b. Multiple files on Wandbox</h3>

<p>
Open <a href="https://wandbox.org/permlink/8OVhQsgezJKQXkMS">this wandbox</a>
(<a href="1b-main.cc">backup</a>, <a href="1b-beta.h">backup</a>).

<p>
1. Try to run the code. It should give you a compiler warning and a linker error.

<p>
2. Fix the compiler warning by adding the missing <code>", %d"</code> to the format string.

<p>
3. Fix the linker error by adding a new file to the wandbox. Click the heavy "+" icon
next to the "beta.h" tab. Click "noname-3" to switch to that tab. Click it again to
rename the new file; enter its new name as "beta.cc". Fill in "beta.cc" yourself with
something that will make the program work.

<p>
Look at the left sidebar, under "Compiler Options". Notice that there are already three
custom compiler options there: <code>-W -Wall -pedantic</code>. Add <code>beta.cc</code>
to the list of compiler options so that Wandbox knows it's supposed to compile it.
Click "Run" to compile and run your multiple-file program!


<h3>Exercise 1c. Experimental options</h3>

<p>
Open <a href="https://wandbox.org/permlink/s2QwWPdmLDNaqCfZ">this wandbox</a>
(<a href="1c.cc">backup</a>). This program uses the
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints">"Concepts Lite" syntax</a>
currently available in a Technical Specification and slated for inclusion in C++20.
This syntax is <i>not</i> standard C++17, but the GCC compiler can support it under
an extension flag.

<p>
1. Change the compiler from Clang to GCC, and add the flag <code>-fconcepts</code>
to GCC's compiler options. Run the code. (It should work.)

<p>
(If you're super into Concepts, you may have noticed that the code in this wandbox
says <code>concept bool</code> where real C++20 code would say <code>concept</code>.
GCC supports an older Concepts syntax, with slight differences from the C++20 syntax.)


<h3>Exercise 1d. Godbolt and Rextester</h3>

<p>
Open <a href="https://godbolt.org/g/X6gEaL">this godbolt</a> (<a href="1a.cc">backup</a>).
Godbolt, unlike Wandbox, shows you the assembly output of the compiler.
Wandbox, unlike Godbolt, can actually link and run the program remotely.

<p>
1. At the top of the right pane, you can change the compiler. Change it to "x86-64 gcc (trunk)".
Notice that the assembly output instantly refreshes; there is no "Run" button on Godbolt.

<p>
To change the compiler quickly: Click the dropdown and hit backspace, then type "gcc trunk"
and hit enter.

<p>
2. Change the compiler options to include <code>-O3</code>. Notice that the assembly output
refreshes --- and it gets much shorter!

<p>
3. Change the compiler to "x86-64 MSVC 19 2017 RTW". This impenetrable acronym means
"Visual Studio 2017." Godbolt supports not just GCC and Clang but also Microsoft Visual Studio
and Intel ICC. (It also supports <a href="http://ellcc.org">ELLCC</a> and
<a href="https://www.zapcc.com">Zapcc</a> which are just forks of Clang.)

<p>
4. Click the "Share" dropdown in the upper right corner of the screen to get a shareable
permalink to your Visual Studio codegen.

<p>
5. Play around with the seven blue/gray buttons underneath the compiler-selection dropdown.
They change the filter applied to the assembly code: exclude comments, flatten whitespace,
show machine code, et cetera. The settings I picked for this exercise seem like the cleanest
ones.

<p>
6. Open <a href="http://rextester.com/ATF90700">this rextester</a> (<a href="1a.cc">backup</a>).
Click the "Run it" button below the source-code entry box. Edit the program to print
"hello rextester" instead of "hello world". Click "Run it". To get a shareable permalink,
click "Put on a wall"; enter something as the snippet's title (doesn't matter), select "Code wall",
and click "OK".

<p>
As far as I know, Rextester is the only freely accessible online compiler service that supports
both <i>running the code</i> and <i>compiling with Visual Studio</i>. But I think its version
of Visual Studio is pretty old.
